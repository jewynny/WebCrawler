[Rules still apply.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) \n\nMuch as we try to keep things orderly, change happens. So this spring the mod team is busy sweeping up the basement, tidying up the rules, running a duster over the FAQ and generally making sure things are clear and accessible.\n\nNaturally, any spring cleaning effort risks the dreaded \"You missed a spot!\" observation. It would be helpful – and appreciated – to know about any specific portions of our rules and FAQ that you find confusing. \n\nWhile we do have a list to review from questions we field in modmail, we hope your comments will point out any other areas of confusion.\n\nThanks for your help! See you next month with more on the project.\n\n---\n\n##As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

In the end of it all, I am planning to take a holiday with a friend or family member to travel to the other side of the world. I am based in the UK and I am thinking Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or somewhere around there where I have never been. \n\nI asked my brother (M43) if he would consider coming with me. He got very excited and said his daughter (F12) and son (M8) would also come along. They are both incredibly picky eaters, and my niece only eats plain beige foods. She won’t even have a burger at McDonalds, just chips and nuggets, and that’s pretty much 80% of the kids’ diet. I know my brother and his wife have tried hard to introduce them to other foods, but they just wont eat it. I love the two kids to bits, I really do. \n\nHowever, I want to travel to experience the food culture and that is a major part of it for me. I want to get off the beaten path and experience things in life I haven’t been brave enough to experience before. For me, selfishly, this trip is about the end of my cancer and celebrating that there is life after cancer. It’s also not something I can easily afford. \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I asked my brother to come travel with me, and when he said his kids would come too, I told him I would rather travel with someone else. He is disappointed and angry with me, and frustrated that I don’t want to travel with his family. He feels I am being selfish as travelling with his children can also be fulfilling. I would also like to spend time with them and do some child friendly things during the holiday. \n\nHe had already gotten my niece and nephew excited about the travel too. To make things worse, we live in different countries so we don’t see each other a lot. They will be very disappointed when they learn I have pulled the plug on the plans. I feel conflicted.\n\nSo, AITA? ", "author_recent_subreddits": ["AmItheAsshole", "UKJobs", "interiordecoratingcj", "AskUK", "MAFS_UK"]},

I’ve been in therapy, on medication, and trying to just keep going. It’s not something I bring up often, especially at family events, but my close family knows. My brother (26M), who’s always been more of the extroverted, golden-child type, has never really gotten it.\n\nA few weeks ago, I attended his wedding rehearsal dinner. He was practicing his speech and making jokes to test the crowd. One of them was along the lines of:\n“And of course, thanks to my brother for coming out of his cave for once. We were worried he wouldn’t make it past level 5 of Depression Dungeon, but here he is!”\n\nEveryone laughed. Except me. I just sat there, frozen, because I didn’t expect to be called out like that, especially not for something I’ve barely talked about publicly.\n\nAfterwards, I pulled him aside and told him the joke really hurt. He brushed it off with: “Come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up.” I didn’t say much else. I left early.\n\nA few days before the actual wedding, I told him I wasn’t going to come. I didn’t make a scene—I just said I wasn’t feeling well and wished him the best. He got angry, said I was being selfish and dramatic, and now the whole family is mad at me for “missing the most important day of his life over one comment.”\n\nI get that weddings are a big deal, and maybe I overreacted, but honestly, I felt humiliated. Like I was a punchline. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay for everyone else’s comfort.\n\nAITA?", "author_recent_subreddits": ["AmItheAsshole", "AskPH", "actuary", "careerguidance"]},

Like, I’m not even exaggerating—he lies about random stuff constantly and forgets what he even said. He’s told people we’ve been friends for years longer than we actually have (which makes no sense because they can just ask me), said he lived in a three-story house when he was in a double-wide, and even made up how much money he has. His lies are almost always easy to fact-check, and honestly, I’ve never judged him for any of that—I was raised not to care about superficial stuff like that.\n\nBut one thing that’s always been weird is that he loves to act like he’s better than everyone, especially when it comes to academics. In high school, he claimed to be on honor roll all four years, never failed a class, had a 4.0 GPA, etc. But I saw him taking credit recovery senior year, and one of my friends saw his grades on a teacher’s computer—and they were bad. Like, really bad.\n\nI still never brought it up. I didn’t judge him, because we all struggle sometimes. In fact, I opened up to him once and told him I technically failed Spanish, but my teacher passed me in the end. He started making fun of me and calling me names, which I didn’t take personally because I know that’s just projection.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to a recent trip to Walmart with our friend group, and somehow we start talking about academics. He decides to rank everyone from “smartest to dumbest”—and puts me last. That really annoyed me because I knew for a fact that he was failing and lying, and I’d never corrected him before. So I finally said, “I know I’m smarter than you academically, I’ve just never cared to correct you on it.”\n\nHe got really upset and hasn’t spoken to me since. Some of my friends said I was being mean, but others think he had it coming.

He and my mother are still married and they have two children - my sister and I. Neither my sister or I have good relationships with my parents. They weren't downright physically ab*sive, but both of them are definitely narcissists and some things they did left deep psychological scars that I still deal with to this day. \n\nIt has always been a running joke for my parents that my dad would perform our wedding ceremonies and Christen our children. This was SOP for my sister's wedding and the birth of her child. This, however, is not something that I want. I can't have my father preach to me and my husband-to-be about love when he has rarely shown it to me throughout my childhood. \n\nSo a few weeks ago, my fiancé and I were having dinner with them and we were discussing our plans for the future. My dad said something along the lines of \"I wonder what message I should give at your ceremony\" and I shot him down immediately, saying that I did not want him to perform the ceremony. He got mad and asked me to explain myself, almost like I had told him I had just k*lled someone. I told him that I still wanted him to walk me down the isle, which made him blow up even more. I finally said that he could choose between being my father or being my pastor. That was the end of the conversation and the end of dinner.\n\nNow he's demanding I apologize, because it's his right as my father to perform the ceremony. He's threatening not to pay for my wedding, and he's saying that if he doesn't perform the ceremony, he and my mother won't be attending.\n\nI am considering cutting all contact and eloping, but I'm scared that I would miss them when the big day comes.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Someone asked me, and we have had this discussion before dinner. It was a part of a larger discussion we had after my sister's wedding, where she said that he had basically forced her into him performing the ceremony, threatening to cut her off and not pay for the wedding. This is his go-to.\n\n2nd Edit (sorry, I am bad at this): I am not planning on asking him to pay for the wedding. My fiancé and I both want a small wedding and have seriously discussed eloping before this happened. So he is down with running away and just letting them know after.", "author_recent_subreddits": ["AmItheAsshole", "AmItheAsshole"]}
